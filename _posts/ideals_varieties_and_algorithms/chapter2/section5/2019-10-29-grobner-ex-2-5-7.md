# Proposition
If we use grlex order with $x > y > z$, is $\\{ x^4y^2 - z^5, x^3y^3 - 1, x^2y^4 - 2z \\}$ a Grobner basis for the ideal generated by these polynomials?

# Solution
It is not.
Let $g_1, g_2, g_3$ denote the three polynomials.
$2xz - y = yg_2 - xg_3 \in I$, thus $2xz \in \LT(I)$.

On the other hand, each $\LT(g_i)$ has a multi-degree of $6$.
Therefore, $2xz \notin \\{ \LT(g_1), \LT(g_2), \LT(g_3) \\}$.
Thus $\\{ g_1, g_2, g_3 \\}$ is not a Grobner basis.
