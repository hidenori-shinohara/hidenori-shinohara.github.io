# Proposition
Let $I \subset k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$ be an ideal with the property that for every $f = \sum c_{\alpha} x^{\alpha} \in I$, every monomial $x^{\alpha}$ appearing in $f$ is also in $I$.
Show that $I$ is a monomial ideal.

# Solution
Let $A = \\{ \alpha \mid \sum c_{\alpha} x^{\alpha} \in I \\}$.
Let $I_A$ be the ideal generated by $\\{ x^{\alpha} \mid \alpha \in A \\}$ 

* $I_A \subset I$ because $\forall \alpha \in A, x^{\alpha} \in I$.
* $I \subset I_A$ because, for every $f \in I$, each monomial of $f$ is in $I_A$.
