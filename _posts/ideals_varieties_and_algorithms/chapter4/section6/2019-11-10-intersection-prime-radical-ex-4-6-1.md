# Proposition
Show that the intersection of any collection of prime ideals is radical.

# Solution
Let $\\{ I_{\alpha} \\}$ be a collection of prime ideals.
Let $f \in k[x_1, \cdots, x_n]$.
Suppose $f^m \in \bigcap_{\alpha} I_{\alpha}$ for some $m \geq 1$.
For all $\alpha$, $f^m \in I_{\alpha}$ implies that $f \in I_{\alpha}$.
Therefore, $f \in \bigcap_{\alpha} I_{\alpha}$, so the intersection of any collection of prime ideals is radical.
