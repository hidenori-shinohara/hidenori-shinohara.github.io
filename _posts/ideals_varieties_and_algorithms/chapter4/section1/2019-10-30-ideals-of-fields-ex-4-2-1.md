# Proposition
Prove that $\\{ 0 \\}$ and $k$ are the only ideals of a field $k$.

# Solution
Let $I \ne \\{ 0 \\}$ be an ideal of $k$.
Such an ideal must exist since $k$ is an ideal of $k$.
Let $x \in I$ such that $x \ne 0$.
Since $k$ is a field, $x^{-1} \in k$.
Thus $1 = x^{-1}x \in I$.
Since $I$ is an ideal, $\forall y \in k, y = y \cdot 1 \in I$.
Thus $I = k$.
