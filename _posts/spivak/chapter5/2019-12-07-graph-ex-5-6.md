# Proposition
If $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$, the graph of $f$ is $\\{ (x, y) \mid y = f(x) \\}$.
Show that the graph of $f$ is an $n$-dimensional manifold if and only if $f$ is differentiable.

# Solution
Suppose $f$ is differentiable.

Let $g: \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ be defined such that $g(x, y) = y - f(x)$.
Since $f$ is differentiable, $g$ is differentiable.
Moreover, $Dg(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} -D_xf(x) & I_m \end{bmatrix}$, so it has rank $m$.
By Theorem 5-1[Spivak], $g^{-1}(0) = \\{ (x, y) \mid y = f(x) \\}$ is an $(m + n - m)$-dimensional manifold.

The converse is not true as discussed [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/69603/an-exercise-in-spivaks-calculus-on-manifolds).
