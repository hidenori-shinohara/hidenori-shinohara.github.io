# Proposition
Suppose $f$ is entire and there exists $M > 0$ such that $\abs{f(z)} > M$ for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$.
Prove that $f$ is constant.

# Solution
Since $f(z) \ne 0$ for any $z \in \mathbb{C}$, $1/f(z)$ is an entire function.
Since $\abs{1/f(z)} < 1/M$, $1/f(z)$ is a bounded entire function.
[By Liouville's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(complex_analysis)), $1/f(z)$ is constant.
Therefore, $f(z)$ must be constant.
