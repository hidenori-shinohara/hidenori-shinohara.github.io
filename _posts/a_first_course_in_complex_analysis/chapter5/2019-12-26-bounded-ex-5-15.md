# Proposition
Suppose $f$ is entire with bounded real part.
Prove that $f$ is constant.

# Solution
Since $f$ is entire, $\exp(f)$ is entire.
$\abs{\exp(f)} = \exp(\Re(f))$ is bounded.
Thus [by Liouville's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liouville%27s_theorem_(complex_analysis)), $f$ is constant.
