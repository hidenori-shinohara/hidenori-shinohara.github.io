# Proposition
Show that all partial derivatives of a harmonic function are harmonic.

# Solution
We are given that $$u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0$$.
Thus $$(u_{xx} + u_{yy})_x = 0$$, so $$u_{xxx} + u_{yyx} = 0$$.
By changing the order of partial derivatives, $$(u_x)_{xx} + (u_x)_{yy} = 0$$.
Thus $u_x$ is harmonic.

Similarly, $u_y$ is harmonic.
