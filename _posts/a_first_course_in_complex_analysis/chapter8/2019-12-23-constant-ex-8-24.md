# Proposition
Prove that if $f$ is entire and $\Im(f)$ is constant on the closed unit disk, then $f$ is constant.

# Solution
Let $c$ be the value that $f$ takes on the closed unit disk.
Let $g(z) = c$ for all $z$.
$g$ is clearly entire.
Then $f$ and $g$ agree on the closed unit disk, which has an accumulation point in $\mathbb{C}$.
Then $f = g$ on $\mathbb{C}$ by [the identity theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_theorem).
