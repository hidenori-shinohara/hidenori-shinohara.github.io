# Proposition
Find a Laurent series for $\frac{z - 2}{z + 1}$ centered at $z = -1$ and the region in which it converges.

# Solution

$$
\begin{align*}
 \frac{z - 2}{z + 1}
  &= \frac{(z + 1) - 3}{z + 1} \\
  &= 1 - \frac{3}{z + 1} \\
  &= \frac{-3}{z + 1} + 1.
\end{align*}
$$

This is a Laurent series with $c_{-1} = -3, c_0 = 1$.
This converges if $z \ne -1$.
