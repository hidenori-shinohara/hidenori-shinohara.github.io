# Proposition
Find a function representing each of the following series.
1. $\sum_{k \geq 0} \frac{z^{2k}}{k!}$
1. $\sum_{k \geq 1} k(z - 1)^{k - 1}$
1. $\sum_{k \geq 2} k(k - 1)z^k$

# Solution
## 1
Based on the Taylor series for $e^z$, it is easy to see that this series represents $e^{z^2}$.

## 2
$\frac{1}{1 - (z - 1)} = \sum_{k \geq 0} (z - 1)^k$.
By taking the derivative on both sides, we obtain $\frac{1}{(2 - z)^2}$.

## 3
$\frac{1}{1 - z} = \sum_{k \geq 0} z^k$.
By taking the derivative twice and multiplying $z^2$, we obtain $\frac{2z^2}{(1 - z)^3} = \sum_{k \geq 2} k(k - 1)z^k$.
