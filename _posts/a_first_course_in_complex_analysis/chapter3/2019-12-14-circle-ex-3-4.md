# Proposition
Show that $f(z) = \frac{z - 1}{iz + i}$ maps any circle passing through -1 to a line.

# Solution
A circle centered at $a \in \mathbb{C}$ passing through -1 can be expressed as the set of $z \in \mathbb{C}$ satisfying $\abs{z - a} = \abs{-1 - a} = \abs{1 + a}$.

For any $z \in \mathbb{C}$, $w = f(z)$ implies $z = (1 + iw) / (1 - iw)$.

Let $w \in \mathbb{C}$ be given.
$w = f(z)$ for some $z$ in the circle if and only if

$$
\begin{align*}
  \abs{\frac{1 + iw}{1 - iw} - a} = \abs{1 + a}.
\end{align*}
$$

This can be simplified to

$$
\begin{align*}
  \abs{w - i\frac{1 - a}{1 + a}} = \abs{w + i}.
\end{align*}
$$

In other words, $w = f(z)$ for some $z$ in the circle if and only if $w$ is equidistant from $i(1 - a)/(1 + a)$ and $-i$.
Therefore, $f$ indeed maps a circle passing through -1 to a line.
