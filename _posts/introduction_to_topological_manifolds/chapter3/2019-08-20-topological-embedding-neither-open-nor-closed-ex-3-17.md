# Proposition
Give an example of a topological embedding that is neither an open map nor a closed map.

Let $A = [0, 1)$.
Then the inclusion map $i_A: A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a topological embedding [as shown here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /introduction_to_topological_manifolds/chapter3/2019-08-20-inclusion-map-topological-embedding-ex-3-13%}).

$A$ is both open and closed in $A$.
However, $i_A(A) = A$ is neither open nor closed in $\mathbb{R}$.
Therefore, $i_A$ is a topological embedding that is neither open nor closed.
