# Proposition
Show that the only Hausdorff topology on a finite set is the discrete topology.

# Solution
Let $X = \\{ x_1, \cdots, x_n \\}$ be a finite Hausdorff space.

For each $i \in \\{ 2, \cdots, n \\}$, $x_1, x_i$ have disjoint neighborhoods $U_i, V_i$.
Then $U_2 \cap \cdots \cap U_n$ is a neighborhood of $x_1$ that only contains $x_1$.
Thus $\{ x_1 \}$ is open.

This argument can be applied to any point in $X$, so $\\{ x_i \\}$ is open for each $i$.
Therefore, $X$ is discrete.
