# Proposition
Suppose that $X$ is a topological space, and $g$ is any path in $X$ from $p$ to $q$.
Let $\Phi_g: \pi_1(X, p) \rightarrow \pi_1(X, q)$ denote the group isomorphism induced by $g$.

1. Show that if $h$ is another path in $X$ starting at $q$, then $\Phi_{g \cdot h} = \Phi_h \circ \Phi_g$.
1. Suppose that $\psi: X \rightarrow Y$ is continuous, and show that the following diagram commutes:

$\require{extpfeil}\Newextarrow{\xRightarrow}{5,5}{0x27f6}$

$$
\begin{gather*}
  \pi_1(X, p) & \xRightarrow{\psi_*} & \pi_1(Y, \psi(p)) \\
  \Phi_g \Big\downarrow &  & \Big\downarrow\Phi_{\psi \circ g} \\
  \pi_1(X, q) & \xRightarrow{\psi_*} & \pi_1(Y, \psi(q)).
\end{gather*}
$$
