# What is Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP)?

Zero-knowledge proof is a field in cryptography that allows people to communicate something without additional information.

Here's a simplified, watered-down version of the famous problem called [the Ali Baba cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof#The_Ali_Baba_cave).

Suppose that there is a cave and the loop contains a magic door.

You can open the magic door by whispering the secret code.

Suppose B wants to show A that they have the secret code.

The easiest approach is to give A the secret code.
However, all B wanted to show was that B _has_ the code.
B would be telling more than they need to.

The second approach is for A to stand in the cave.
B can go in and make a circle.
If B has the secret code, then they can come back out from the other side.

Then A has no information on the secret code, but A can be certain B has the code.

This can be useful for many financial applications.
For instance, the bank might ask your credit score when you want a mortgage.
Chances are, they need to know your credit score is above a certain threshold.
However, with the current system, you have to tell them your exact credit score.

In other words, you want to prove that your input results in `true` for the following algorithm:

```
credit_score_good_enough(my_credit_score)
    if my_credit_score >= min_credit_score_required
           return true
    else
           return false
```

The algorithm can be public, but you don't want your _input_ `my_credit_score` to be public.

The main idea behind ZK is that this algorithm can be converted into polynomials.
