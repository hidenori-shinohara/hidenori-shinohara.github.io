# Limits of FHE

Data dependent branching is an extremely complex topic in FHE.
Consider this simple algorithm:

```
def f(flag, a ,b):
    if flag:
        return a
    else:
        return b
```

If `flag`, `a`, and `b` are all given in cypher texts, then I can't return the correct value as I won't be able to decipher `flag`.
One possible approach is to do a calculation like `flag * a + (1 - flag) * b` where `flag` is assumed to be either 0 or 1.
This gives a mathematically correct answer, but this is computationally different.

To make it more obvious, look at this example:

```
def f(flag, a ,b):
    if flag:
        return super_expensive_function_1(a)
    else:
        return super_expensive_function_2(b)
```

If we returned `flag * super_expensive_function_1(a) + (1 - flag) * super_expensive_function_2(b)`, we will likely perform both expensive functions.
However, conventional programming languages will evaluate only one of them.

Another example is a conditional loop.
It is not obvious at all how one could make a conditional loop possible work with FHE.


# Lattice
Let $n$ be a natural number.
Let $v_1, \cdots, v_n \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\\{ v_1, \cdots, v_n \\}$ forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
We call $\\{ \sum c_i v_i \mid c_i \in \mathbb{Z} \\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ a _lattice_.


# Closest Vector Problem
Consider a lattice $L$ formed by $v_1, \cdots, v_n$.
Let $x = (x_1, \cdots, x_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n \setminus L$.
Then the problem of finding $v \in L$ such that $\abs{v - x} \leq \abs{v' - x}$ for all $v' \in L$ is called the _closest vector problem_.
