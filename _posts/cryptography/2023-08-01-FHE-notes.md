# Limits of FHE

Data dependent branching is an extremely complex topic in FHE.
Consider this simple algorithm:

```
def f(flag, a ,b):
    if flag:
        return a
    else:
        return b
```

If `flag`, `a`, and `b` are all given in cypher texts, then I can't return the correct value as I won't be able to decipher `flag`.
One possible approach is to do a calculation like `flag * a + (1 - flag) * b` where `flag` is assumed to be either 0 or 1.
This gives a mathematically correct answer, but this is computationally different.

To make it more obvious, look at this example:

```
def f(flag, a ,b):
    if flag:
        return super_expensive_function_1(a)
    else:
        return super_expensive_function_2(b)
```

If we returned `flag * super_expensive_function_1(a) + (1 - flag) * super_expensive_function_2(b)`, we will likely perform both expensive functions.
However, conventional programming languages will evaluate only one of them.

Another example is a conditional loop.
It is not obvious at all how one could make a conditional loop possible work with FHE.


# Lattice
Let $n$ be a natural number.
Let $v_1, \cdots, v_n \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ such that $\\{ v_1, \cdots, v_n \\}$ forms a basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$.
We call $\\{ \sum c_i v_i \mid c_i \in \mathbb{Z} \\} \subset \mathbb{Z}^n$ a _lattice_.


# Closest Vector Problem
Consider a lattice $L$ formed by $v_1, \cdots, v_n$.
Let $x = (x_1, \cdots, x_n) \in \mathbb{Z}^n \setminus L$.
Then the problem of finding $v \in L$ such that $\abs{v - x} \leq \abs{v' - x}$ for all $v' \in L$ is called the _closest vector problem_.

# Shortest Vector Problem
Consider a lattice $L$ formed by $v_1, \cdots, v_n$.
Let $s = \min \\{ \abs{v} \mid v \ne 0 \in L \\}$.
Then the problem of finding a $v \in L$ such that $\abs{v} = s$ is called the shortest vector problem.

A shortest vector always exists.
Proof: For any nonzero vector in $L$, there are finitely many shorter vectors in $L$ as each vector has only integer coefficients.

# Learning with Error
Consider a lattice $L$ formed by $v_1, \cdots, v_n$.
Let $R^n$ be the vector space for which $L$ is a subspace.
Suppose that $v_1, \cdots, v_n$ are sufficiently large.

I will flip a coin and give you one vector.
- If heads, then I'll pick a random vector $v \in L$ and pick a sufficiently small error $e \in R^n$ and give you $v + e$.
- If tails, then I'll give you a random vector $R^n$.

The problem of figuring out which vector I gave  you is called the LWE problem.
It is easy to see that a solution to CVP will solve this problem efficiently.
