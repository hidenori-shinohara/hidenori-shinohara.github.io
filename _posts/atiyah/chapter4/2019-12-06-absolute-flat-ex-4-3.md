# Proposition
If $A$ is absolutely flat, every primary ideal is maximal.

# Solution
We will use the results of Exercise 2.28 and [1.10](/2019/11/27/nilradical-properties-ex-1-10) [Atiyah].

Let $p$ be a primary ideal of $A$.
Then $A / p \ne 0$ and every zero divisor of $A / p$ is nilpotent.
Let $x + p \in A / p$ be a non-unit element.
Then $x$ does not have an inverse in $A$.
