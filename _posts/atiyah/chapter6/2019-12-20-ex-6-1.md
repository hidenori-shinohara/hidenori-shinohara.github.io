# Proposition
1. Let $M$ be a Noetherian $A$-module and $u: M \rightarrow M$ a module homomorphism.
   If $u$ is surjective, then $u$ is an isomorphism.
1. If $M$ is Artinian and $u$ is injective, then again $u$ is an isomorphism.

# Solution
## 1
$\ker(u) \subset \ker(u^1) \subset \ker(u^2) \subset \cdots$ is an ascending chain of submodules of $M$.
Since $M$ is Noetherian, there must exist $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $\ker(u^n) = \ker(u^{n + 1}) = \cdots$.
We want to show that $\ker(u) = 0$ by using the following two properties repeatedly:

1. $\ker(u^n) = \ker(u^{n + 1})$, so if $u^{n + 1}(x) = 0$, then $u^n(x) = 0$.
1. $u$ is surjective, so for any $x \in M$, there exists $x' \in M$ such that $u(x') = x$.

Let $x \in \ker(u)$.
Since $\ker(u) \subset \ker(u^{n + 1})$, $u^{n + 1}(x) = 0$.
* By Property 1, $u^n(x) = 0$.
* By Property 2, $x = u(x_1)$ for some $x_1 \in M$.
  Therefore, $0 = u^n(x) = u^n(u(x_1)) = u^{n + 1}(x_1)$.
* By Property 1, $u^n(x_1) = 0$.
* By Property 2, $x_1 = u(x_2)$ for some $x_2 \in M$.
  Therefore, $0 = u^n(x_1) = u^n(u(x_2)) = u^{n + 1}(x_2)$.
