# Proposition
Let $M$ be a Noetherian $A$-module and let $a$ be the annihilator of $M$ in $A$.
Prove that $A / a$ is a Noetherian ring.
If we replace "Noetherian" by "Artinian" in this result, is it still true?

# Solution

Since $M$ is Noetherian, it is finitely generated by Proposition 6.2 [Atiyah].
Let $M = \ev{x_1, \cdots, x_n}$.
$A / \Ann(x_i)$ is isomorphic to $Ax_i$ as $A$-modules through the module isomorphism $a + \Ann(x_i) \mapsto ax_i$.
Since $Ax_i$ is a submodule of $M$, we have the exact sequence $0 \rightarrow Ax_i \rightarrow M \rightarrow M / Ax_i \rightarrow 0$.
By Proposition 6.3(i), $Ax_i$ must be Noetherians, so $A / \Ann(x_i)$ is Noetherian.

This implies that $A / \Ann(x_i)$ is Noetherian for every $i$.
By [Problem 6-3](/2019/12/10/noetherian-ex-6-3.html), $A / (\Ann(x_1) \cap \cdots \cap \Ann(x_n))$ is Noetherian.
Since $\Ann(M) = \Ann(x_1) \cap \cdots \cap \Ann(x_n)$, $A / \Ann(M) = A / a$ is Noetherian.

TODO: Solve the Artinian case.
