# Proposition
Let $A$ be a local ring, $M$ and $N$ finitely generated $A$-modules.
Prove that if $M \otimes_A N = 0$, then $M = 0$ or $N = 0$.

# Solution

Suppose $M \ne 0$ and $N \ne 0$.
We will show that $M \otimes_A N \ne 0$.

Let $m$ be $A$'s maximal ideal.
Let $k = M / m$.
Then $M_k = k \otimes_A M = A / m \otimes_A M = M / mM$ [as shown in this post](/2019/11/23/module-exact-sequence-ex-2-2.html).
Since $M \ne 0$, $mM \ne M$ by Nakayama's Lemma.
Therefore, $M_k = M / aM \ne 0$.
Similarly, $N_k \ne 0$.

Then $M_k, N_k$ are vector spaces over a field $k$.
Since $M$ and $N$ are finitely generated $A$-modules, $M_k$ and $N_k$ must be finitely generated as well.
In other words, $M_k$ and $N_k$ are finite-dimensional vector spaces.
Let $\\{ m_1, \cdots, m_l \\}, \\{ n_1, \cdots, n_{l'} \\}$ be bases of $M_k$ and $N_k$.
Since $M_k \ne 0$ and $N_k \ne 0$, $l \geq 1$ and $l' \geq 1$.

Define $\phi: M_k \times N_k \rightarrow k$ by $\phi(\sum a_im_i, \sum b_in_i) = a_1b_1$.
Then $\phi$ is $k$-bilinear.
By Proposition 2.12[Atiyah], there exists a unique $k$-linear mapping $\phi': M_k \otimes_k N_k \rightarrow k$ such that $\phi(x, y) = \phi'(x \otimes y)$ for all $x, y \in M_k, N_k$.

Then $\phi'(m_1 \otimes n_1) = \phi(m_1, n_1) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \ne 0 = \phi'(0 \otimes 0)$.
Therefore, $M_k \otimes_k N_k$ contain at least two distinct elements, so $M_k \otimes_k N_k \ne 0$.

$$
\begin{align*}
  M_k \otimes_k N_k
    &= (k \otimes_A M) \otimes_k (k \otimes_A N) \\
    &= k \otimes_A (M \otimes_k (k \otimes_A N)) \\
    &= k \otimes_A ((M \otimes_k k) \otimes_A N) \\
    &= k \otimes_A (M \otimes_A N).
\end{align*}
$$

If $M \otimes_A N = 0$, then $k \otimes_A (M \otimes_A N) = 0$.
Therefore, $M \otimes_A N \ne 0$.
