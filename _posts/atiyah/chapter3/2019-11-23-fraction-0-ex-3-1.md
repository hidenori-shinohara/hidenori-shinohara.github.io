# Proposition
Let $S$ be a multiplicatively closed subset of a ring $A$, and let $M$ be a finitely generated $A$-module.
Prove that $S^{-1}M = 0$ if and only if there exists $s \in S$ such that $sM = 0$.

# Solution
Suppose that there exists $t \in S$ such that $tM = 0$.
Let $(m, s) \in S^{-1}M$ be given.
Then $t(m - 0) = 0$, so $(m, s) \equiv (0, 1)$.

On the other hand, suppose $S^{-1}M = 0$.
Since $M$ is finitely generated, there exist $m_1, \cdots, m_n \in M$ such that $M = \\{ a_1m_1 + \cdots + a_nm_n \mid a_1, \cdots, a_n \in A \\}$.
For each $m_i$, $(m_i, 1) \equiv (0, 1)$, so there must exist $t_i \in S$ such that $t_im_i = 0$.
Let $t = t_1 \cdots t_n$.
Then $\forall a_1m_1 + \cdots + a_nm_n \in M, t(a_1m_1 + \cdots + a_nm_n) = a_1(tm_1) + \cdots + a_n(tm_n) = 0$.
