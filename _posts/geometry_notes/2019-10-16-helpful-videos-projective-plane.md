When I first learned $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$, I could understand the definition, but I could not at all understand why that would ever be useful.
Here is a list of videos that made me appreciate $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^2$.

* [Projective geometry and homogeneous coordinates](https://youtu.be/q3turHmOWq4)
    * This video explains how the real projective plane includes a plane with "a line at infinity".
* [Projective geometry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYK0GBQVngs)
    * This video is made by the same professor.
      This is much longer than the previous one, but this contains much more information.
* [Projective view of conics and quadrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1crGLAVCwn4)
    * Again, by the same professor.
      This is much more advanced, and this is a lecture from his differential geometry class.
