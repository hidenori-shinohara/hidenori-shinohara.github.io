# Problem
Given maps $X \rightarrow Y \rightarrow Z$ such that both $Y \rightarrow Z$ and the composition $X \rightarrow Z$ are covering spaces, show that $X \rightarrow Y$ is a covering space if $Z$ is locally path-connected, and show that this covering space is normal if $X \rightarrow Z$ is a normal covering space.

# Questions

* What is the hypothesis?
    * $X, Y, Z$ are topological spaces.
    * $Z$ is locally path-connected.
    * $p: X \rightarrow Y, q: Y \rightarrow Z$ are maps.
    * $q \circ p$ and $q$ are covering maps.
* What is the conclusion?
    * $p$ is a covering space.
* Separate the various parts of the hypothesis.
* Find the connection between the hypothesis and the conclusion.
* Look at the conclusion! And try to think of a familiar theorem having the same or a similar conclusion.
* Keep only a part of the hypothesis, drop the other part; is the conclusion still valid? Could you derive something useful from the hypothesis? Could you think of another hypothesis from which you could easily derive the conclusion? Could you change the hypothesis, or the conclusion, or both if necessary, so that the new hypothesis and the new conclusion are nearer to each other?
* Did you use the whole hypothesis?
