I have been listening to the audio book *Make It Stick*, and I decided to use some approaches presented in the book.

# The bean bag example
The book claims that, in order to get good at a 3-foot toss, it is better to practice 2-foot and 4-foot tosses than a 3-foot toss.

- I will try to take hard classes, and in my free time, I will work on an easy textbook.
