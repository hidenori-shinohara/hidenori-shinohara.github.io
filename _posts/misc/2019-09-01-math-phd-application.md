Getting a PhD is hard, but applying to a PhD program is also very hard!

# 1: Find 3 professors for recommendation letters!

This will be by far the most important aspect of your application.
Make sure:

* You have *3* professors!
  Almost every school in the US requires 3 letters.
  I couldn't find a third professor, so I had to wait a year before I could apply.
* They will write strong letters!
  Professors will tell you if they don't think they can write strong letters.

# 2: Take the GRE math subject test ASAP!

This is not the math section of the regular GRE.
The math subject test consists of calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra and various other topics like complex analysis.
It takes a lot of time to prepare for this, so make sure to take the April one.

# 3: Read DAGAP!

[*Demystifying the American Graduate Admissions Process*](https://nlp.stanford.edu/~rkarthik/DAGAP.pdf) is a document by a CS student at Stanford, but much of what is written there is applicable to math students.
This answers questions like:

* Do I need to do well on the GRE Verbal section?
* Is my statement of purpose important? 
* What is a good GPA?

# 4: Talk to your recommendation letter writers!

They are generally the best resource because they are very familiar with your level and interests.
If not, they shouldn't write your letter.

You can (and you should) look for information online.
But you should be getting as much advice as possible from your recommendation letter writers as well.
