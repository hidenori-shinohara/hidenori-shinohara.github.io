I was a software engineer at Google for 3 years after getting my Bachelor's degree, and now I'm starting a math PhD program.

# It's hard to learn much in industry.

Google generally encourages learning, but I learned much less than I did in college.
Much of my work time was devoted to meetings and emails, and there was not enough time for me to learn new things.

# SWE stuff wasn't interesting to me

I did learn SWE stuff like software design, but it was just not interesting to me.

# Lack of control of what I wanted to do.

In industry, you can't just do what you want to do.
Of course, you can't do *anything* in grad school, either, but you have much more control over that.
