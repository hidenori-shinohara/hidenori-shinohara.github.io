I was a software engineer at Google for 3 years after getting my Bachelor's degree, and now I'm starting a math PhD program.

# It's hard to learn much in industry.

Much of my work time was devoted to meetings and emails, and there was not enough time for me to learn new things.

# SWE stuff wasn't interesting to me

I did learn some SWE stuff like software design, but I did not find it very interesting.

# Lack of control of what I wanted to do.

You have much more control over that in graduate school.
