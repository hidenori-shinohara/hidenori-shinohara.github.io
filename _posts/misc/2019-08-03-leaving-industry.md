I worked as a software engineer at Google for 3 years after getting my Bachelor's degree, and now I'm starting graduate school.

* I couldn't learn much in industry.
    * Google generally encourages learning, but it is still much less than graduate school.
      Much of my work time was devoted to meetings, emails and such, and there was not enough time for me to learn new things.
    * While working there, I took graduate courses after work twice a week, and I felt that I learned more there than I did at work.
* What I learned in industry was not interesting.
    * I didn't find software engineering interesting.
* I didn't have much control of what I wanted to do.
    * I just had to do what I was told to do.
      I tried to go the extra mile a few times, then I got myself into a trouble.
* The "innocent until proven guilty" effect.
    * If I have a different idea from someone at a higher level, it was my responsibility to prove that mine is better because their idea would be assumed to be better.
      And I hate arguing things like that.
* I'm not a team player.
    * I just want to do things my way on my own.
