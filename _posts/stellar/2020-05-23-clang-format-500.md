1. Download [Clang Version 5.0.0 for macOS (.sig)](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html).
   (Scroll down a bit, and you'll see 5.0.0.)
1. Unzip it by clicking it.
1. `cd ~/Downloads/clang+llvm-5.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin`.
1. Run `ls` and confirm that you see `bin`, `include`, `lib`, `libexec` and `share`.
1. Run `sudo cp -R * /usr/local/`.
    * *NOTE*: In retrospect, I think it's better to do `sudo cp -R bin/clang-format /usr/local/bin/`.
    * It is because I couldn't build stellar-core after doing this step.
    * I'm not certain if it was because of this, but I think it's just better to only move clang-format.
    * I actually realloy don't know which one is better. If I don't move everything, there might be some dependency issues.
1. Run `clang-format --version`.
1. Most likely, macOS will complain that the program can't be trusted.
   Open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy.
   You will probably see something about `clang-format` there.
1. Once you are done with that, go back to the terminal, and run `clang-format --version`.
1. Hopefully, you will see `clang-format version 5.0.0 (tags/RELEASE_500/final)`.
