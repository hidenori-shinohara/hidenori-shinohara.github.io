1. Download [Clang Version 5.0.0 for macOS (.sig)](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html).
   (Scroll down a bit, and you'll see 5.0.0.)
1. Unzip it by clicking it.
1. `cd ~/Downloads/clang+llvm-5.0.0-x86_64-apple-darwin`.
1. Run `ls` and confirm that you see `bin`, `include`, `lib`, `libexec` and `share`.
1. Run `sudo cp -R * /usr/local/`.
1. Run `clang-format --version`.
1. Most likely, macOS will complain that the program can't be trusted.
   Open System Preferences and go to Security & Privacy.
   You will probably see something about `clang-format` there.
1. Once you are done with that, go back to the terminal, and run `clang-format --version`.
1. Hopefully, you will see `clang-format version 5.0.0 (tags/RELEASE_500/final)`.
