Important property in Modern Cryptography and Elliptic Curves - A Beginnerâ€™s Guide.

> For any prime $p \geq 3$, $U_p$ has exactly $(p - 1) / 2$ squares.


More formally, we are trying to show:

$$
\begin{align*}
    \abs{ \{ x \in U_p \mid \exists y, y \cdot y = x \} } = \frac{p - 1}{2}.
\end{align*}
$$

[In a previous post](/2023/08/16/modern-cryptography-and-elliptic-curves-elliptic-curve-cyclic.html), we showed that $U_p$ is cyclic.

Let $\phi$ be an isomorphism from $U_p$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{p - 1}$.

Let $x \in U_p$ be given.

$$
\begin{align*}
    \exists y, y \cdot y = x
        &\iff \exists y, \phi(y) + \phi(y) = \phi(x) \\
        &\iff \exists y', y' + y' \equiv \phi(x) \pmod{p - 1} \\
        &\iff \phi(x) \in \{ 0, 2, 4, \cdots, (p - 3) \}
\end{align*}
$$

as $p - 1$ is an even number.
Therefore, there are exactly $\frac{p - 1}{2}$ squares.

Now, we will make a (surprisingly accurate) guess on the number of points on an elliptic curve.

First, we assume $f$ maps numbers uniformly randomly.
More specifically, we assume $f$ maps $\mathbb{Z}_p$ into itself.
Then there are exactly $(p - 1) / 2$ $x$'s such that $f(x)$ is a quadratic residue in $U_p$.
For each $x$ like that, there are two points $(x, \pm y)$ in an elliptic curve.

Then there is exactly one $x$ such that $f(x) = 0$.
That produces one point $(x, 0)$.

Finally, we have $[0, 1, 0]$.

Combining these, we have $(p - 1) + 1 + 1 = p + 1$.

[Hasse's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasse%27s_theorem_on_elliptic_curves) shows that this estimate is surprisingly accurate.
