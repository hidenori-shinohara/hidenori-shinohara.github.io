Hello!
I'm Hidenori.
I usually go by Hide (pronounced as HEE-Day).

# Experience

* I graduated with a degree in math from the University of Minnesota in 2016.
* I was a software engineer at Google from 2016 to 2019.
* A PhD student in mathematics at Duke from 2019 to 2020. (dropped out)
* I was a software engineer for the Core team at Stellar Development Foundation from 2020 to 2023.

# Interests
My interests lie in the intersection of software engineering, mathematics and theoretical mathematics.

My main academic interest was always in mathematics.
I generally prefer finite/countably infinite/algebraic/discrete/combinatorial mathematics like cryptography/number theory to smooth/differential/uncountably infinite mathematics like data science/stats/machine learning.

My programming background is in algorithmic programming contests such as ICPC/CodeForces.

Some of the theories/theorems/algorithms that I have found beautiful are:
(Note: Not necessarily something that I'm an expert in)

- Abelâ€“Ruffini theorem: A polynomial of degree 5 or above has no radical solution in general
- Segment Tree
- Group theory
- Point-set topology
- $\epsilon\text{-}\delta$ definition of a limit
- Disjoint set union trees
- Zero-knowledge proof
- Category theory
- Formal verification of distributed system protocols
- Paxos
- Stellar Consensus Protocol
- Amortized analysis
- Dynamic programming (Espeically, bottom-up)
- Haskell (Functors, monoids, ...)
- Matroids
- Elliptic curve cryptography
