Hello!
I'm Hidenori.
I usually go by Hide (pronounced as HEE-Day).

# Experience

* I graduated with a degree in math from the University of Minnesota in 2016.
* I was a software engineer at Google from 2016 to 2019.
* A PhD student in mathematics at Duke from 2019 to 2020. (dropped out)
* I was a software engineer for the Core team at Stellar Development Foundation from 2020 to 2023.

# Interests
My interests lie in the intersection of software engineering, mathematics and theoretical computer science.

My main academic interest has always been in mathematics.
I generally prefer finite/countably infinite/algebraic/discrete/combinatorial mathematics like cryptography/number theory to smooth/differential/uncountably infinite mathematics like data science/stats/machine learning.

My programming background is in algorithmic programming contests such as ICPC/CodeForces.

Some of the theories/theorems/algorithms that I have found beautiful are:
(Note: Not necessarily something that I'm an expert in)


- Math
    - Group theory
    - Point-set topology
    - Category theory
    - Matroid theory
        - Senior project.
          I found it interesting that matroids abstract the concept of linear algebra,
          and I also found it interesting that we can use matroids to prove some greedy algorithms.
    - Abel–Ruffini theorem: A polynomial of degree 5 or above has no radical solution in general
        - I first heard this in high school,
          and proving this theorem in college/grad school was one of the most satisfying moments I've had in math.
    - $\epsilon\text{-}\delta$ definition of a limit
        - I disliked calculus with passion for not having any rigorous argument,
          but this fixed that problem for me.
- Algorithms/data structures
    - Segment Tree
        - The versatility in this data structure, especially in programming contest problems, brought me a lot of joy.
    - Disjoint set union trees
        - It's simple yet so powerful.
    - Amortized analysis
    - Dynamic programming (Especially, bottom-up)
         - I learned the tower of Hanoi before I learned programming and I didn't know there was a whole field behind it.
    - Floyd-Warshall algorithm
        - It's simple yet so powerful.
    - Miller–Rabin primality test
        - So counter-intutive in the beginning, yet it makes so much sense once you learn it.
- Misc
    - Zero-knowledge proof
    - Formal verification of distributed system protocols
        - This is where I learned about distributed systems and their challenges.
          I spent about a year working on formal verification of SCP in Ivy,
          and it was one of the most rewarding and cool experiences I've had with computers.
    - Consensus protocols such as Paxos and the Stellar Consensus Protocol
    - Haskell (Functors, monoids, ...)
        - Haskell was my first programming language!
          I learned it for fun with friends and started solving Project Euler problems.
    - Elliptic curve cryptography
