Hello!
I'm Hidenori.
I usually go by Hide (pronounced as HEE-Day).

# Experience

* I graduated with a degree in math from the University of Minnesota in 2016.
* I was a software engineer at Google from 2016 to 2019.
* A PhD student in mathematics at Duke from 2019 to 2020. (dropped out)
* I was a software engineer for the Core team at Stellar Development Foundation from 2020 to 2023.

# Interests
My interests lie in the intersection of software engineering, mathematics and theoretical computer science.

My main academic interest has always been in mathematics.
I generally prefer finite/countably infinite/algebraic/discrete/combinatorial mathematics like cryptography/number theory to smooth/differential/uncountably infinite mathematics like data science/stats/machine learning.

My programming background is in algorithmic programming contests such as ICPC/CodeForces.

Some of the theories/theorems/algorithms that I have found beautiful are:
(Note: Not necessarily something that I'm an expert in)


- Math
    - Group theory
    - Point-set topology
    - Category theory
    - Matroid theory
    - Abel–Ruffini theorem: A polynomial of degree 5 or above has no radical solution in general
    - $\epsilon\text{-}\delta$ definition of a limit
- Algorithms/data structures
    - Segment Tree
    - Disjoint set union trees
    - Amortized analysis
    - Dynamic programming (Especially, bottom-up)
    - Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    - Miller–Rabin primality test
- Misc
    - Zero-knowledge proof
    - Formal verification of distributed system protocols
    - Paxos
    - Stellar Consensus Protocol
    - Haskell (Functors, monoids, ...)
    - Elliptic curve cryptography
